Dear all, this is the dataset for ASR class. Thank you all for the contribution to this dataset.
The dataset can be divided into two parts: training part and testing part.
In the training part, we have 440 templates, from digit zero to nine. You can use all or part of them as your training data.
And in the testing dataset, I random choose 40 samples from all your submission.  All 40 samples in the testing dataset should be used to evaluate your system.
